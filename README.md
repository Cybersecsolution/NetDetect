# **NetDetect**

NetDetect is a powerful diagnostic tool for real-time network path visualization and analysis. This tool provides detailed insights into network paths, including geolocation data, latency statistics, and proxy/VPN detection.

---

## **Features**
- Real-time network path analysis.
- Detailed hop-by-hop statistics.
- Geolocation data (Country, State, City).
- Proxy/VPN detection and ASN details.
- Risk assessment per hop.

---

## **Prerequisites**
Before using NetDetect, ensure you have the following:
- A Linux-based operating system.
- `jq`, `curl`, and `mtr` installed.
- Sudo privileges.

---

## **Installation**

### **Step 1: Install Required Dependencies**
Run the following command to install necessary dependencies:
```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt install jq curl mtr -y
```

### **Step 2: Download the Script**
Download the script to your desired directory:
```bash
cd ~
wget -O mtr-netdetect.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Cybersecsolution/NetDetect/refs/heads/main/mtr-netdetect.sh
```

### **Step 3: Make the Script Executable**
Provide execute permissions to the script:
```bash
chmod +x mtr-netdetect.sh
```

---

## **Usage**

### **Run the Script**
1. Navigate to the directory containing the script:
   ```bash
   cd /path/to/script
   ```

2. Execute NetDetect with the following command:
   ```bash
   sudo ./mtr-netdetect.sh google.com
   ```
   Replace `google.com` with the domain or IP address you want to analyze.

---

## **Optional Global Installation**
If you'd like to run NetDetect globally:
1. Move the script to `/usr/local/bin`:
   ```bash
   sudo mv mtr-netdetect.sh /usr/local/bin/
   ```
2. Run the script from anywhere:
   ```bash
   mtr-netdetect.sh google.com
   ```

---

## **Stopping the Script**
To stop the script, press:
```text
Ctrl + C
```
This will cleanly exit and reset the terminal.

---

## **Output Details**
NetDetect provides the following insights:
- **Hops**: Number of network hops.
- **Loss%**: Packet loss percentage.
- **Latency Stats**: Last, Average, Best, Worst, and Standard Deviation.
- **Geolocation**: Country, State, and City.
- **Proxy/VPN Detection**: Indicates if the hop uses a proxy or VPN.
- **ASN**: Autonomous System Number.
- **Risk Score**: Threat risk score.

---

## **Troubleshooting**

### **Error: Command Not Found**
- Ensure you're in the correct directory where `mtr-netdetect.sh` is located.
- Use the absolute path:
  ```bash
  /path/to/mtr-netdetect.sh google.com
  ```

### **Permission Denied**
- Add executable permissions:
  ```bash
  chmod +x mtr-netdetect.sh
  ```

### **Dependencies Missing**
- Install `jq`, `curl`, and `mtr`:
  ```bash
  sudo apt install jq curl mtr -y
  ```
